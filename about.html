    <h2> <em>About</em> </h2>
    <p><strong>Azad Namazie (they/them) is an Iranian-Chilean writer, artist, and digital archivist from Los Angeles, CA.</strong> Their artistic practice explores queer transmission culture, Persian mythology, and the interactions between secrecy and desire. Some of their other artistic inspirations include mourning doves, field recordings, DVD menus, Sufi mysticism, and mycelial networks.</p>
    <p>Azad's performance work has been featured at Celebration Theatre, Zephyr Theatre, and Hollywood Fringe Festival, while their poetry has appeared in Mizna Journal, About Place Journal, and FRUITSLICE, among others. Their plays include <strong>Another Birth</strong> (commissioned and produced by Celebration Theatre & Greenway Arts Alliance), <strong>LOCAL PROPHETS: A Play of Near Collisions</strong> (The Joy Who Lived Festival 2025), and <strong>The Roadside Bathhouse</strong> (PlaygroundLA x Eight Ball Theatre Writer's Workshop). Other theatrical credits include dramaturgy for <strong>Memory Lane is a Desert Road</strong> (Eight Ball Theatre) and curation of a pre-show archival exhibition for <strong>A Third Space</strong> (Hollywood Fringe Festival 2024).</p>
    <p>As an archivist, Azad is dedicated to supporting artists and grassroots organizations to design sustainable digital archives programs to autonomously preserve and defend their materials from digital loss, extraction, and proprietary systems. They have processed, preserved, and made accessible audiovisual and born-digital collections at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Viet Rainbow of Orange County, and Skid Row History Museum. They are a digital archivist at UCLA Library.</p>
