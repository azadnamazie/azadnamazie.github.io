Their plays include Another Birth (commissioned and produced by Celebration Theatre & Greenway Arts Alliance) and LOCAL PROPHETS: A Play of Near Collisions (The Joy Who Lived Festival 2025).</p>

    <p>As an archival consultant, they bring experience building digital archives programs at UCLA Library, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Skid Row History Museum & Archive.

    <p><em>They also coded this website from scratch which explains the extremely crude early internet aesthetic.</em> They have been thinking about disruptions to the technocapitalist world order through concepts like solidarity infrastructures, minimal computing, and "low tech." </p>
