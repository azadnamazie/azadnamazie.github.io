    <p><strong>Azad Namazie (they/he) is a poet, performance artist, and digital archivist from Los Angeles, CA.</strong> They create websites, archives, and multimedia performances for live and internet audiences. Through their work, they hope to resurrect archival specters, elevate spiritual consciousness, and reclaim our technological imagination.</p>

Their plays include <strong>Another Birth</strong> (commissioned and produced by Celebration Theatre & Greenway Arts Alliance), <strong>LOCAL PROPHETS: A Play of Near Collisions</strong> (The Joy Who Lived Festival 2025), and <strong>The Roadside Bathhouse</strong> (PlaygroundLA x Eight Ball Theatre Writer's Workshop).

    <p>As an archivist, Azad is dedicated to supporting artists and grassroots organizations to design sustainable digital archives programs to autonomously preserve and defend their materials from digital loss, surveillance, and proprietary systems.
